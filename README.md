# G-CODE-Ripper
G-Code Ripper is a g-code reading and manipulation program written in python. The root features of the program were written from scratch. The Graphic User Interface (GUI) is based heavily on the GUIs I wrote for F-Engrave and Dmap2Gcode. G-Code Ripper is a free open source program released under the GNU General Public License (GPL) Version 3.

This is 0.23 version of G-CODE Ripper updated by SileliS which supports DrufelCNC (https://drufelcnc.com/).
